# Canvas Checklist (Optional)

The following checklist can help SmartPAL better answer student questions.

- Always set **due dates** for deliverables such as assignments and quizzes.
- Include **descriptions** for exams, quizzes, and modules (e.g. what topics do they cover, exam preparation tips etc)
- Using a **grading scheme**: [See a guide here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Admin-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-grading-scheme-in-an-account/ta-p/146), so that we can translate the Canvas course score into a letter grade.
- Maintain the Canvas grade book to provide an accurate running total, including:
    - Ensure that every assignment has a **point value** assigned to enable correct grade calculation. 
    - Regularly enter grades for all assignments
    - Utilize [**weighted assignment groups**](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-weight-the-final-course-grade-based-on-assignment/ta-p/746) if you use weighted grading.
    - Enter **"0" for missing submissions** (Canvas ignores all ungraded assignments when calculating a student's total grade, even those that are past due)
- Offer the **syllabus** using Canvas's "Syllabus" function (an inline syllabus is preferred over an attachment): [See a guide here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-use-the-Syllabus-as-an-instructor/ta-p/638).
- For subjectively graded questions, it would be helpful to use a grading rubric: [See a guide here](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-a-rubric-to-an-assignment/ta-p/1058).
