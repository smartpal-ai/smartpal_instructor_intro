# Deployment Options

SmartPAL can be deployed in **two different modes**, depending on your course goals and preferences:

- **As an Instructional Tool** – Use SmartPAL as a teaching and learning support tool  
- **As Research Participation** – Use SmartPAL as part of an approved research study on learning technologies  

---

## Option 1: Deploy SmartPAL as Instructional Tool

The Instructional Tool mode allows you to use SmartPAL as a teaching and learning support tool, similar to other instructional technologies.

**Key characteristics**

- No IRB involvement
- No required surveys
- Participation credit optional
- Minimal instructor overhead

**Best suited for**

- First-time SmartPAL users
- Courses where participation credit or research framing is not desirable

**Data use**

- Aggregate, de-identified usage data used for platform improvement
- Not used for human subjects research



---

## Option 2: Deploy SmartPAL as Research Participation

The Research Participation mode allows SmartPAL to be used as part of an IRB-approved study on learning technologies.

**Key characteristics**

- Covered by IRB approval (student consent exempt)
- Voluntary participation by students
- Background and post-course surveys
- Participation credit required (e.g., 1-2% extra credit or course credit)
- Low instructor overhead

**Best suited for**

- Instructors interested in contributing to learning research
- Instructors comfortable offering participation incentives

**Incentives**

- A small amount of participation incentives is **required** to compensate students for the additional time and sustained effort required

**Data use**

- De-identified data used for IRB-approved research
- Aggregate, de-identified usage data used for platform improvement

## Side-by-Side Comparison

|  | Instructional Tool Mode | Research Participation Mode |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **IRB Requirement** | None | Yes |
| **Surveys** | None required | Background and post surveys |
| **Participation Credit** | Optional | Required |
| **Instructor Overhead** | Minimal | Low |
| **Data Use** | Platform improvement only | IRB-approved learning research |
| **Best For** | First-time users; courses where research framing is not desirable | Instructors interested in contributing to learning research |

👉 Continue with the [Instructional Tool Mode](instructional-tool.md) if your primary goal is to support student learning with minimal additional requirements.

👉 Continue with the [Research Participation Mode](research-participation.md) if you are interested in contributing to evidence-based insights on AI-supported learning.

**Not Sure Which Option Is Right?**

- Most instructors start with the **Instructional Tool Mode** and later choose to participate in research after gaining experience with SmartPAL.
- You are welcome to discuss options with the SmartPAL team before deciding.
