# Academic Integrity

## How does SmartPAL protect sensitive content?

SmartPAL fully respects Canvas visibility settings. Unpublished or locked quizzes, assignments, and documents are not included in the SmartPAL chatbot knowledge base. Similarly, unreleased grades will not be revealed to students.


## AI Use During Assessments

SmartPAL includes a GenAI-powered chatbot. If GenAI tools are not permitted during exams or quizzes, students should not be allowed to use SmartPAL during those assessments. We recommend communicating this policy clearly to students.
