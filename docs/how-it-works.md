# How SmartPAL Works

## How Does SmartPAL Interact with Students?

SmartPAL is designed to enhance course engagement throughout the learning lifecycle using a combination of AI assistance and gamification.

- **Chatbot**: A GenAI-powered chatbot that answers course-related questions ("pull" from students) and sends reminders, updates, encouragement, and nudges ("push" to students).
- **Gamification**: Game elements such as gems, levels, avatars, and leaderboards motivate engagement. Gems are awarded for activities such as on-time submission, Canvas pageviews, and answering reflection questions.

  
SmartPAL is accessible through a mobile app or a Canvas-integrated web app:

- **Dashboard**: Current course score, gamification metrics, and upcoming/overdue assignments synced from Canvas
- **Chatbot**: Course-related Q&A and notifications
- **Leaderboard**: Anonymized list of most-engaged students
