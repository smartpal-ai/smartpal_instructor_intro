# Privacy & Data Protection

## General Data Practice

SmartPAL follows strict FERPA-compliant practices:

- No data selling
- No data used for advertising
- No identifiable data used to train general-purpose AI models
- De-identified data may be retained for research (if applicable) & platform improvement
- Identifiable student information deleted shortly after the pilot ends
- Secure encrypted storage

## Student Privacy Protections 

**AI chat content privacy**: 

- Detailed AI chat transcripts are not shared with instructors, TAs, administrators, or other instructional stakeholders.
- Instructional stakeholders may receive non-identifiable, aggregate engagement indicators (e.g., overall usage counts or broad activity levels) to inform course-level instructional decisions, without access to individual chat content or prompts.

**AI-guided assignment interaction privacy**: 

- SmartPAL does not provide instructors, TAs, or administrators access to students’ full AI interaction transcripts (e.g., step-by-step prompts or conversational exchanges).
- Instructors may receive student-submitted artifacts (such as drafts, revisions, or final work) only when these are explicitly part of the assignment requirements.
- SmartPAL may generate limited, non-content activity indicators (e.g., number of interactions or general interaction length) to support instructional insights, without revealing the substance of student–AI conversations.

**Peer privacy**: 

- Students cannot view other students' individual data or activity. 
- Any peer-facing features (e.g., leaderboards) use **anonymized or pseudonymized representations** that do not reveal student identities.

**Reflection visibility and boundaries**: 

- Students are clearly informed that reflections submitted as part of course activities may be shared with instructors or TAs **for pedagogical purposes only**. 
- Any reflections explicitly designated as **private** are **not shared** with instructors, TAs, or other stakeholders.
