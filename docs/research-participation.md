# Deploy SmartPAL as Research Participation

## Research Participation Incentives

### Why incentives are needed

Participation in SmartPAL research includes activities beyond normal course requirements, such as weekly structured reflections and completion of background and post-study surveys. The reflection activities are designed to support learning through metacognitive practice and facilitate instructor-driven support, while also contributing to research on learning processes. Incentives are provided to fairly compensate students for the additional time and sustained effort required, to encourage consistent participation throughout the study period, and to support high-quality reflection and feedback essential for both instructional improvement and research. Participation is entirely voluntary.

### Incentive Options

Based on instructor preferences, research participation incentives can be set up as:

- **Extra Credit**: Students earn a small amount of extra credit (e.g., ~1-2%) for participating
- **Course Credit**: SmartPAL activities count toward a small portion (e.g., ~1-2%) of the regular course grade

## Canvas Setup

SmartPAL automatically creates and manages Canvas elements to minimize instructor workload:

### SmartPAL Assignments

SmartPAL organizes assignments into two **assignment groups**:

- **SmartPAL Assignments**: House SmartPAL-related assignments except weekly reflections. This keeps SmartPAL activities separate from your regular course assignments.

    - **SmartPAL Background Survey**: Assignment for the background survey
    - **SmartPAL Post Survey**: Assignment for the end of course survey    
    - **SmartPAL App Activation (zero-credit)**: A zero-credit assignment for activating SmartPAL for the course
    - **SmartPAL Reflection Credit**: Assignment for representing total reflection points
    - **SmartPAL Engagement Credit**: Assignment for representing total learning engagement points

- **SmartPAL Reflections**: House weekly reflection assignments (one per eligible week).


In addition, in courses using **weighted grading scheme** and assigning **Extra Credit** for SmartPAL, a **SmartPAL Extra Credit** assignment may be created to represent the extra credit for SmartPAL. 

### SmartPAL Module

The **SmartPAL Module** contains:

- Overview (Page)
- The SmartPAL Student Guide (page)
- Research information sheet (file)
- SmartPAL assignments (assignments)

### Gradebook setup


SmartPAL handles all research participation grading **automatically**—instructors do not need to grade any SmartPAL assignments manually.

| Activity | Description | Grading Mode | Grade/Status Posting |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **App Activation** | Activate SmartPAL for the course | Binary | Immediately |
| **Background Survey** | Complete the background survey | Binary | Immediately |
| **Post Survey** | Complete the post survey | Binary | Immediately |
| **Weekly Reflections** | Complete brief weekly reflections | Binary | Immediately |
| **Reflection Credit** | Complete a target number of reflections | Proportional | Updated weekly, released in the last week |  
| **Engagement Credit** | Obtain a target number of engagement points (gems) | Proportional | Updated weekly, released in the last week |  


- Grades are updated regularly throughout the semester
- SmartPAL grades are finalized by the last day of instruction
<!-- - Instructors receive access to a dashboard showing student progress and can contact us with any grading questions.-->

## What Are Needed from Instructors?

### Before The Course Starts

Preferably at least one week before first class,

1. **Give SmartPAL Access to Your Canvas Course(s)**. 
      - Each institution has a designated **SmartPAL user account**, usually "smartpal@domain-name" (e.g. smartpal@umn.edu for University of Minnesota)
      - We ask you to **add SmartPAL user account as a Teacher** to your course. This gives SmartPAL access to your course, allowing it to retrieve needed information for SmartPAL to function and manage the SmartPAL related Canvas items.
2. **Determine the Participation Incentives**
      - As part of research participation, we ask students to complete two surveys, complete weekly reflections, and earn engagement gems. We use participation incentives to reward students for these activities.  
      - We recommend approximately **1-2% worth of extra credit or course credit**. 
      - **Please let us know how much incentive you plan to provide (in percentage or points), and whether you prefer course credits or extra credits** 
      - If you prefer a lighter-weight setup without surveys or required incentives, consider the [**instructional tool mode**](instructional-tool.md).
3. **Include Syllabus Language about SmartPAL (Recommended)**: 
      
      > **SmartPAL Research Participation**
      >
      > This course offers SmartPAL, a research-based digital learning support tool connected to our Canvas course. It helps students stay organized, reflect on their learning, receive encouragement and reminders, and answer course-related questions. Use of SmartPAL is part of an ongoing research study examining how learning technologies can enhance student learning experiences. Participation in the research component is voluntary, and specific course incentives (such as participation or extra credit, if applicable) will be specified by the instructor. SmartPAL is designed to support your learning; it does not replace course instruction or graded assessments.
      >
      > Because SmartPAL includes a generative AI–powered chatbot, its use is prohibited for any assignment, assessment, or activity **in which generative AI tools are not permitted**, unless explicitly authorized by the instructor.

### On the first day of class

- We will ask you to briefly introduce SmartPAL Research Participation and encourage students to participate.
- A short video (and/or a simple slide deck) will be provided. 

### During the course

- We encourage you to check out the weekly instructor briefing, instructor dashboard, and the instructor chatbot
- Please forward any SmartPAL-related questions to [support@smartpal.org](mailto:support@smartpal.org)

### At the end of the course

- By default, SmartPAL related grades are **finalized by the last day of instruction**. 
- If you have any questions, please reach out to [**support@smartpal.org**](mailto:support@smartpal.org).
- We will ask you to fill out a simple instructor feedback survey (participation is voluntary).
