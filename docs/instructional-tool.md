# Deploy SmartPAL as an Instructional Tool

## Optional Participation Incentives

### Why participation incentives?

While students may voluntarily use SmartPAL features to support their learning, some participation in SmartPAL includes activities beyond typical course requirements, such as weekly structured reflection exercises. These reflection activities are designed to support learning through metacognitive practice, encourage deliberate engagement with course material, and provide instructors with feedback to inform instruction. 

Because these activities require additional time and sustained effort across the semester, participation incentives can be used to encourage consistent reflection and meaningful engagement.

### Participation Incentive Options

Instructors may adopt one of the following approaches for SmartPAL participation:

- **No Credit**: SmartPAL participation, including reflection activities, is entirely voluntary and does not affect course grades.
- **Extra Credit**: Students may earn a small amount (e.g. ~1%) of extra credit for completing weekly reflections and other SmartPAL participation activities.
- **Course Credit**: SmartPAL activities, such as weekly reflections, count toward a small portion (e.g. ~1%) of the course participation or engagement grade.

If you're already comfortable with SmartPAL and interested in contributing to AI learning research, consider the [**research participation mode**](research-participation.md).

## Canvas Setup

SmartPAL automatically creates and manages Canvas elements to minimize instructor workload:

### Assignments

SmartPAL organizes assignments into two **assignment groups**:

- **SmartPAL Assignments**: House SmartPAL-related assignments except weekly reflections. This keeps SmartPAL activities separate from your regular course assignments.

    - **SmartPAL Post Survey (zero-credit)**: A very short voluntary survey at the end of the course for tool feedback and improvements.    
    - **SmartPAL App Activation (zero-credit)**: Assignment for activating SmartPAL for the course
    - **SmartPAL Reflection Credit** (if participation incentives are provided): Assignment for representing total reflection points
    - **SmartPAL Engagement Credit** (if participation incentives are provided): Assignment for representing total learning engagement points

- **SmartPAL Reflections**: House weekly reflection assignments (one per eligible week).


In addition, in courses using **weighted grading scheme** and assigning **Extra Credit** for SmartPAL, a **SmartPAL Extra Credit** assignment may be created to represent the extra credit for SmartPAL. 

### SmartPAL Module

The **SmartPAL Module** contains:

- Overview (Page)
- The SmartPAL Student Guide (page)
- SmartPAL assignments (assignments)

### Gradebook setup

SmartPAL handles all SmartPAL participation grading (which may be zero credit) **automatically**—instructors do not need to grade any SmartPAL assignments manually.

| Activity | Description | Grading Mode | Grade/Status Posting |
|----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **App Activation** | Activate SmartPAL for the course | Binary | Immediately |
| **Post Survey** | Complete the post survey | Binary | Immediately |
| **Weekly Reflections** | Complete brief weekly reflections | Binary | Immediately |
| **Reflection Credit** (if applicable) | Complete a target number of reflections | Proportional | Updated weekly, released in the last week |  
| **Engagement Credit** (if applicable) | Obtain a target number of engagement points (gems) | Proportional | Updated weekly, released in the last week |  


- Grades are updated regularly throughout the semester
- SmartPAL grades are finalized by the last day of instruction

## What Are Needed from Instructors?

### Before The Course Starts

Preferably at least one week before first class,

1. **Give SmartPAL Access to Your Canvas Course(s)**. 
      - Each institution has a designated **SmartPAL user account**, usually "smartpal@domain-name" (e.g. smartpal@umn.edu for University of Minnesota)
      - We ask you to **add SmartPAL user account as a Teacher** to your course. This gives SmartPAL access to your course, allowing it to retrieve needed information for SmartPAL to function and manage the SmartPAL related Canvas items.
2. **Determine Whether to Offer Participation Incentives**
      - Offering a small amount of participation credits is helpful, but optional, for sustaining participation and engagement activities that go beyond typical course requirements (such as weekly reflections).  
3. **Include Syllabus Language about SmartPAL (Recommended)**: 
      
      > **SmartPAL Learning Support**
      >
      > This course offers SmartPAL, a digital learning support tool connected to our Canvas course. It helps students stay organized, reflect on their learning, receive encouragement and reminders, and get course-related learning support. Use of SmartPAL is voluntary - it does not replace course instruction or graded assessments. 
      >
      > Because SmartPAL includes a generative AI–powered chatbot, its use is prohibited for any assignment, assessment, or activity **in which generative AI tools are not permitted**, unless explicitly authorized by the instructor.

### On the first day of class

- We will ask you to briefly introduce SmartPAL and encourage students to leverage it.
- A short video (and/or a simple slide deck) will be provided. 

### During the course

- We encourage you to check out the weekly instructor briefing, instructor dashboard, and the instructor chatbot
- Please forward any SmartPAL-related questions to [support@smartpal.org](mailto:support@smartpal.org)

### At the end of the course

- If participation incentives are provided, SmartPAL related grades are **finalized by the last day of instruction**. 
- If you have any questions, please reach out to [**support@smartpal.org**](mailto:support@smartpal.org).
- We will ask you to fill out a simple instructor feedback survey (participation is voluntary).
