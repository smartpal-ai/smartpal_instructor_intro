The overarching &amp; long-run goal of the project is to help students better regulate their own learning and achieve their learning goals in a supportive, informative, and fun environment, while empowering the instructors with automated reports and dashboard.  </p> <p>SmartPal is available as an iOS/Android app that serves as a personal learning assistant connected to Canvas.  The app consists of four main screens, (a) a dashboard (with current grade and upcoming dues, synced from Canvas), (b) a LLM-powered chatbot for chatbot-initiated (e.g. upcoming/overdue assignment reminders, reflections, performance feedback, and goal progress notifications) and student-initiated conversations (questions about syllabus, schedule, assignments, grades, and content), and (c) a  gamification leaderboard showing the top-N (typically top 20%)  most-engaged students.  The screenshots below are illustrative and we will have a refreshed design for this semester.</p>"}]}
