It bridges the gaps between Canvas, students, and instructors.</p> <ul> <li>For students: We provide an iOS/Android app serves as a personal learning assistant connected to Canvas. The app has a build-in GenAI-powered chatbot, a dashboard, and a leaderboard. Students can ask the chatbot courses related questions and also receive chatbot-initiated reminders, updates, and nudges. </li> <li>For instructors: We provide weekly newsletters via email and a web-based teacher dashboard. Below, we describe SmartPAL in a bit more detail. </li> </ul> <p>The current SmartPAL deployment is primarily meant to support research, which entails evaluation of a few learning technologies and their designs. We use the information gathered to drive insights on impact and effectiveness of technologies and suggest design improvements.</p> <p>Here is a short demo of SmartPAL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frgNlcm70XM</p>"},{"location":"#how-does-smartpal-interact-with-students","title":"How Does SmartPAL Interact with Students?","text":"<p>SmartPAL is designed to enhance course engagement throughout the learning lifecycle.

We usually recommend some participation incentives to complete these steps.  <ul> <li>We recommend 1-2% worth of extra credit (or course credit) given to students for this research participation.
