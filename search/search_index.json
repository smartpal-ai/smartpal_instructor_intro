It bridges the gaps between Canvas, students, and instructors.</p> <ul> <li>For students: We provide an iOS/Android app serves as a personal learning assistant connected to Canvas. The app has a build-in GenAI-powered chatbot, a dashboard, and a leaderboard. Students can ask the chatbot courses related questions and also receive chatbot-initiated reminders, updates, and nudges. </li> <li>For instructors: We provide weekly newsletters via email and a web-based teacher dashboard. Below, we describe SmartPal in a bit more detail. </li> </ul> <p>The current SmartPal deployment is primarily meant to support research, which entails evaluation of a few learning technologies and their designs. We use the information gathered to drive insights on impact and effectiveness of technologies and suggest design improvements.</p> <p>Here is a short demo of SmartPal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frgNlcm70XM</p>"},{"location":"#how-does-smartpal-interact-with-students","title":"How Does SmartPal Interact with Students?","text":"<p>SmartPal is designed to enhance course engagement throughout the learning lifecycle.

This gives us access to your course, and we can use this teacher role to retrieve course and student information using Canvas API, and make updates such as upload SmartPal related documents and grades.</li> <li>Sometimes, we may add one or two members of the research team as an observer or TA (you don't need to do anything), e.g. Tao Li (li003479@umn.edu) and Fagun Raithatha (raith011@umn.edu) </li> </ul> </li> <li>Determine the Participation Incentives: As part of the research, we need students to complete a pre survey (at the beginning of the semester) and a post survey (at the end), and to install the SmartPal app. Students may require some incentives to complete these steps.  <ul> <li>We recommend 1-2% worth of extra credit (or course credit) given to students for this research participation. That said, we can still deploy SmartPal without credit incentives, though our past experiences indicate that students are less likely to try the app or complete the surveys.</li> <li>Please let us know whether you are willing to offer such extra points/credits, and how much. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Include Syllabus Language about SmartPal: Include some language about SmartPal in the syllabus, which we will share with you.  </li> <li>(Optional) Checklist for Canvas:The follow checklist can help SmartPal better answer student questions.<ul> <li>Always set due dates for deliverables such as assignments and quizzes.</li> <li>Include descriptions for exams, quizzes, and modules (e.g. what topics do they cover, exam preparation tips etc)</li> <li>Using a grading scheme: See a guide here, so that we can translate the Canvas course score into a letter grade.</li> <li>Maintain the Canvas grade book to provide an accurate running total, including:<ul> <li>Ensure that every assignment has a point value assigned to enable correct grade calculation. </li> <li>Regularly enter grades for all assignments</li> <li>Utilize weighted assignment groups if you use weighted grading.</li> <li>Enter \"0\" for missing submissions (Canvas ignores all ungraded assignments when calculating a student\u2019s total grade, even those that are past due)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Offer the syllabus using Canvas's \"Syllabus\" function(an inline syllabus is preferred over an attachment): See a guide here.</li> <li>For subjectively graded questions, it would be helpful to use a grading rubric: See a guide here.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"#on-the-first-day-of-class","title":"On the first day of class","text":"<p>We will ask you to show some slides/a short video about SmartPal, and encourage them to participate in this research.  </p>"},{"location":"#at-the-end-of-the-term","title":"At the end of the term","text":"<p>Usually, we keep smartpal-related grades updated and such grades are finalized by the last day of instruction.
